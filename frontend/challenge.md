# Frontend Coding Challenge

### Solve the following task and create a README.MD (for details see [here](#READMEMD))

### Code
1. Create a WebApp based on the hokify design, using **Vue 3** and **Nuxt 3 **


- This app contains a form with the following fields
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email address
    - A select field with selection options for e.g. gender
    - And a comment field, in which you can enter a message with a maximum of 150 characters
- When you click on the ‘Send’ button, a success message appears with ‘Hello `<first name> <last name>`. Welcome to hokify!’.
2. Use **Pinia** to save the form data. In addition, there is a navigation option to another page where you can view and reset (delete) the data.
3. On another route, fetch some data from any free online API, and show it in a list. The list should contain at least 10 items. When you click on an item, a detail view should open (in a modal or on a new page). The detail view should present more information about the clicked item.
4. Implement a **Darkmode** (preferably in Tailwind), which can be activated and deactivated by a toggle (set colours dynamically). The toggle should be available on every page (for example in the header).
5. (Optional) Improve the form so that it can only be sent if it is a syntactically valid email address. Make sure that your form complies with common A11Y guidelines (e.g. via ARIA).

### What we would be happy about:

- If you use **Tailwind**
- If you use **Typescript**

### README.MD
- Create a README.MD file in which you describe the following things:
    - How did you approach the challenge?
    - What ideas / thoughts did you have?
    - What problems did you encounter?
    - Please also add an **exact description** of how we can test your code. (e.g. via pnpm run dev)
    - Also let us know which package manager you used (and which one we should use)
        - NPM
        - PNPM
        - YARN

## Submit your coding challenge:
- Create a private GitHub repository and add your **code**.
- Add your **README.MD**.
- Give **@triepl** read access to this repository.
- Let us know via email that your challenge is ready. We will get back to you as soon as we have looked at the code. :)
